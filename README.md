# Color_Guess_Game_GUI

This is simple Color guess game with GUI that is built by using Netbeans IDE. 

(There is no gurantee that it will run correctly if you use different IDE than Netbeans)

There are only 5 colors: Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, and Purple

If you like to add more colors, feel free to modify the codes.

*Netbeans IDE sometimes has minor error with not organizing text files correctly.

*Please build and clean, then click run. Close tabs that are open. Please re-run and play.

*This error only happens when you first run it, but does not happen again once you re-run the source code

General rules:

- Each correct guess gets 100 points, each wrong guess gets 0 points

- User need to click correct colored button based on text, not the color of the text

- User can play upto 5 rounds

- To end the game, simply clikc exit button
